# Airdrop Feature

{% hint style="warning" %}
**NOTE:** The feature is temporarily disabled
{% endhint %}

This feature helps creators easily set up an airdrop post and ask participants to comment according to the instructions provided. Each participant who follows the instructions correctly will receive a reward.

## **Pre-condition**

Ensure that you (the airdrop post owner) have enough of the airdrop token in your Capminal account balance.

## **Required**

Your airdrop post should include the following information:

1. Amount of tokens per recipient (not the total amount)
2. Token symbol and token address
3. Number of participants (can be X premium or not, just add keyword 'premium' 'blue checkmark'...)
4. Instructions for users to comment

## **Notes**

1. When airdrop creator prompt the post, you should place the instruction at first to make sure Captain can read your full content, the remain content keep as next.
2. Remind your users to register a Capminal account first, as tokens will be sent directly to their Capminal accounts.
3. The airdrop post becomes active once you receive a “ready” confirmation from Captain. If you reply sooner than confirm message from Captain, you maybe doesn't receive airdrop.
4. Captain will only respond to users who receive the airdrop. Due to high comment volume, responding first does not guarantee being handled first, please be happy if you don’t get an airdrop.
